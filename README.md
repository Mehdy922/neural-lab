# Neural Lab

A classroom web app: teams draw two things, train a real tiny neural network in the
browser, score ~100% on their own drawings, then watch the number collapse when their
model meets other teams' drawings. Overfitting and dataset bias, discovered rather than
defined. Second period: Bendy Fence (dots, a 1–8 neuron slider, class challenges).

Live: https://mehdy922.github.io/neural-lab/

## One-time setup (teacher, ~5 minutes)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com → **Add project** → any name → turn Google Analytics **off** → Create.
2. Left menu **Build → Authentication → Get started → Sign-in method → Anonymous → Enable → Save**.
3. **Build → Realtime Database → Create database** → pick a location → **Start in locked mode** → Enable.
   Then open the **Data** tab and copy the database URL shown at the top (it looks like
   https://…-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com or https://…-default-rtdb.<region>.firebasedatabase.app).
   You'll need it in step 6.
4. **Rules** tab → replace everything with the contents of `database.rules.json` → **Publish**.
5. Project settings (gear icon) → **General → Your apps → Web (</>)** → nickname anything → Register → copy the `firebaseConfig` values.
6. Use the URL copied in step 3 for `databaseURL`; the other four values (`apiKey`, `authDomain`,
   `projectId`, `appId`) come from the web-app config in step 5.
   Easiest: on GitHub open `src/firebaseConfig.js` → pencil icon (Edit) → replace the `PASTE_…`
   values → Commit changes directly to `main` (or clone the repo, edit locally, commit and push).
   GitHub Actions rebuilds and deploys automatically (Actions tab shows progress).
7. Firebase console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains → Add domain →
   `mehdy922.github.io`.
8. GitHub → repo Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions. (Already done for this repo;
   needed for forks or re-dos.)

Everything runs on Firebase's free Spark plan. No card needed. Limits: 100 simultaneous
connections, 1 GB stored, 10 GB/month download — plenty for a class.

Troubleshooting:
- Page says "Could not sign in" with `auth/admin-restricted-operation` or `auth/operation-not-allowed` → step 2 (Anonymous) is not enabled.
- `auth/unauthorized-domain` → see step 7 (Authorized domains).
- Students see "permission denied" toasts → step 4 (rules) not published, or published to a different database.

## Running a lesson

1. Open the live URL → choose **1 · Teach the machine** → **Teacher** → set the pair (default Mango vs Cricket ball; try Sun vs Flower), max students per team, and optionally a max number of teams (2–20; blank = no limit) → **Create room**. Teams don't need to be full: a team of 2 and a team of 4 both count. All of these can be changed later in **Settings**.
2. Put the Lobby on the projector: room code + QR.
3. Students: open the URL → **Student** → code + name → create or join a team.
4. Press **Start teaching**. Students draw 5 of each, **Train**, test with **What is it?**, then **Send my machine to the class**.
5. Press **Reveal tournament**. Open the Tournament tab on the projector. Wait for the noise.
6. Second period: **Open bendy fence**.

Teacher tips, run sheet and the one rule are in the **Settings** tab inside the room.

### Activity 2 · Talk to the machine

1. On the first screen, choose **Activity 2 · Talk to the machine** instead of Activity 1 (Teacher and Student join the same way after that).
2. Students join and form teams exactly as in Activity 1.
3. Press **Start chatting**. Students ask HistoryBot anything and vote Right / Wrong / Nonsense on its answer.
   They'll see: *"HistoryBot has read one thing in its life: 2,000 words about South Asian history. Ask it anything."*
4. Press **Reveal scoreboard**. Open the Scoreboard tab on the projector — accuracy on history vs. everything
   else, broken down by topic.
5. Press **Start training**. Each team picks a starter text (biology, cricket, cooking, space, folktales or
   history) for its own bot, trains it, and sends it.
6. Press **Open cross-examination**. Every team now questions strangers' bots and votes on the answers.
   They'll see: *"Every bot is now questioned by strangers. Which one survived?"* The leaderboard ranks bots
   by how well they do on questions from OUTSIDE their own team.

`npm run simulate -- --activity 2` runs this whole flow against bots for a dry run — see **Bot simulator** below.

Because this activity adds `votes`, `bots` and `botVotes` to `database.rules.json`, any already-deployed
project's live rules must be republished (setup step 4) before running Activity 2 for real.

## Bot simulator

`scripts/simulate.mjs` plays a full lesson against bots (one anonymous Firebase user per student, exactly
like a phone in class) so you can rehearse before class or sanity-check a change to the rules.

```bash
npm run simulate                                          # Activity 1, 9 students, 3 max teams
npm run simulate -- --students 12 --max-teams 4 --rounds 2 --keep
npm run simulate -- --activity 2 --students 10 --max-teams 4 --hold 300
```

- `--activity 2` runs "Talk to the machine" instead of the default "Teach the machine": create the room →
  students join and form teams → `chat` (every student asks HistoryBot 3 questions and votes, then the topic
  table prints) → `reveal` → `train` (each team trains a bot from a starter text and sends it) → `exam`
  (every student cross-examines two other teams' bots, then the leaderboard prints) → the three activity-2
  rule checks (phase write, another team's bot, editing a vote) → cleanup.
- `--students N` / `--max-teams M` control the class size and number of teams the same way for both activities.
- `--hold S` keeps the finished room open for S seconds (e.g. to look at it on a phone) before cleaning up;
  `--keep` leaves the room in the database instead of cleaning up at all.
- Rule checks expect writes to be DENIED and are skipped automatically when run against the local emulator
  (`FIREBASE_DATABASE_EMULATOR_HOST` set, or `--emulator`) — production sign-in tokens are admin there, so
  `npm run test:rules` is what actually exercises the rules.

## The lesson slides

`slides/Neural-Lab-Lesson.pptx` is a 30–40 minute lesson for grades 9–12 that runs *before* the activity
("How does a machine learn?"), with speaker notes and timings on every slide. Slides 1–14 are the lesson and
end by launching the activity; slides 15–19 are the debrief, to be shown only after the tournament reveal.
It uses fonts that ship with Windows and Office, so it opens the same on the school PC.

The deck is generated (`npm run slides`) from `slides/build.mjs` using the app's palette and screenshots in
`slides/img/`. To refresh the screenshots: `npm run simulate -- --rounds 2 --hold 600`, note the room code it
prints, then `npm run screenshots -- --room CODE` while the room is open.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173/neural-lab/
npm test             # unit tests (Vitest, jsdom)
npm run test:rules   # security rules against the Firebase emulator (needs Java)
npm run build
```

## After the first deploy

- Bookmark the room URL you create — the teacher role is tied to this browser (anonymous sign-in). Clearing site data or switching browsers means creating a new room.
- To re-use the app next term: open the live URL → Teacher → Create room. Old rooms stay in the database until you delete them in the Firebase console (Realtime Database → `rooms`).

## Layout

- `src/ml/` — the network, drawing capture (auto-crop + centre), cross-scoring
- `src/rooms/` — room codes, phases, RTDB API, live-state hooks
- `src/screens/` — Landing, TeacherCreate, StudentJoin, Room, Lobby, Teach, Tournament, Fence, Settings
- `database.rules.json` — who may write what
- `docs/superpowers/specs/` — design spec; `docs/prototype/` — original single-file prototype
